Anomaly detection is the identification of rare events, items, or observations which are suspicious because they differ significantly from standard behaviors or patterns. Anomalies in data are also called standard deviations, outliers, noise, novelties, and exceptions.

1. Isolation Forest 
2. Local Outlier Factor (LOF)
